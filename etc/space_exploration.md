In the context of default Space Exploration, here are the shortest paths to "undo" a recipe.

#   Nomenclature

Please refer to the README for the nomenclature.

For ease of reading, the recipes present the negative & positive polarities in separate groups, while the solve paths
present the catalysts in a separate group.


#   Non-Science

##  Naquium Tesseract

The recipe itself:

    LX + Z -> EP + T | P + GO

Of note: the second alternative exhibits flipped polarity, requiring at least one inversion to restore it.

Solve paths:

    TODO


##  Naquium Processor

The recipe itself:

    EP + GOTZ -> LLLLLX | LXXXXX

Of note: both alternatives exhibit flipped polarity, requiring at least one inversion to restore it.

Solve paths:

    TODO


#   Advanced Science II

##  Macroscale Entanglement Data

The recipe itself:

    L + OT -> L + GZ | X + OT

Solve paths:

    TODO


##  Singularity Application Data

The recipe itself:

    E + OT -> E + GZ | P + OT

Solve paths:

    TODO


##  Timespace Manipulation Data

The recipe itself:

    EL + O -> EL + G | PX + O

Solve paths:

    TODO


#   Deep Space Science III

##  Space Dilation Data

The recipe itself:

    OZ -> LL | PP

Of note: both alternatives exhibit flipped polarity, requiring at least one inversion to restore it.

Solve paths:

    TODO


##  Space Folding Data

The recipe itself:

    LX -> EP | TZ

Of note: the second alternative exhibits flipped polarity, requiring at least one inversion to restore it.

Solve paths:

    EP + G  =>  PG -> XO | EO -> LG
    EP + O  =>  EO -> LG | PG -> XO

    TODO (2nd path)


##  Space Injection Data

The recipe itself:

    GT -> ZZ | EE

Of note: the second alternative exhibits flipped polarity, requiring at least one inversion to restore it.

Solve paths:

    TODO


##  Space Warping Data

The recipe itself:

    EP -> TZ | GO

Of note: both alternatives exhibit flipped polarity, requiring at least one inversion to restore it.

Solve paths:

    TODO


#   Deep Space Science IV

##  Wormhole Data

The recipe itself:

    EL + GZ -> PX + OT

Of note: no alternative in this one.

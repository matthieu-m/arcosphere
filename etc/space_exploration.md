In the context of default Space Exploration, here are the shortest paths to "undo" a recipe.

#   Nomenclature

Please refer to the README for the nomenclature.

For ease of reading, the recipes present the negative & positive polarities in separate groups, while the solve paths
present the catalysts in a separate group.

The recipe itself:

    LX + Z -> EP + T | P + GO

Of note: the second alternative exhibits flipped polarity, requiring at least one inversion to restore it.

Solve paths:

    TODO
